### How To Install

> You need to install [python](https://python.org) 3.12, 3.13 and higher might not work.

> After installing python 3.12, download the source code as a zip file, and extract it as a folder into your desktop, then launch a command prompt inside that folder, then run:

> `pip install -r requirements.txt` or,

> `py -3.12 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` if you have multiple python versions downloaded.

### If you have git and python 3.12 installed already;

> If you want to try this method but don't have git installed, you can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> You can download python 3.12 from [here](https://www.python.org)

> Run this standalone command in your terminal that lets you run the program without needing to do anything else,

> `git clone https://github.com/zgndia/spelling-bee-game && cd spelling-bee-game && py -3.12 -m pip install -r requirements.txt && py -3.12 main.py`

### Customization

> These difficulty levels might not include all the words or may not be up to date, so feel free to fork this project!

> If you want to add more levels/words, edit the text files or create a new txt file inside the 'words' folder.

> If you want to include a homophone of a word, provide them in the same line, but split them with a comma;

> `favorable, favourable`
