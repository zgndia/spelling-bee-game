# How To Install

You need to install [python](https://python.org) 3.12, 3.13 won't work.
After installing python 3.12, download the source code as a zip file, and extract it as a folder into your desktop, then launch a command prompt inside that folder, then run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` or, `py -3.12 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
` if you have multiple python versions downloaded.
